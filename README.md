im cool ik
A custom Synapse X user interface with the following changes:

A brand new look! But, just like the same old Synapse you know.
A new color scheme!
Animations!
Custom controls. no Bunifu UI skidded shit!
Synapse X library syntax highlighting within the AceEditor!
(Actually) working AceEditor script file system!
Built-in error help information!
Easy installation!
And much more!

Btw this is just an improved version of asunaxx-aaa's ui.

The installation is super simple.

Simply head over to the "Releases" tab and download the latest SynapseUI.exe from under the Assets.

Once downloaded, simply drag and drop this into your already pre-existing Synapse X folder and open it.

Note: First run may take longer as the UI will auto-download all the required files.

This Synapse UI can auto-update both itself and the additional files. Meaning you will automatically get the latest version of this UI.
